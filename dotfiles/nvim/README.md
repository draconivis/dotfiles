# [neovim](https://neovim.io/)

hyperextensible vim-based text editor

## config

~~i used the [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) config as a starting point and it evolved from there.~~
after using kickstart, i watched this [beginner guide series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn&si=I4AVZqZtu4DN_a-H) on youtube (channel recommendation btw) to set up the config
and copied some things over from the kickstart config (like the automatic setup for lsp handlers)

### dependencies

make sure to install `ripgrep` as it's needed for telescope
