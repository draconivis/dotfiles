# alacritty

my alacritty setup uses jetbrains mono (so don't forget to install it) and has gruvbox colors added to it from [here](https://github.com/eendroroy/alacritty-theme/blob/master/themes/gruvbox_dark.yaml)

you only have to set the `normal` font setting, because the non-configured settings fall back to it
