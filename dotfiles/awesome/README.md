## setup

### Lockscreen

The lockscreen i use is [i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy).

For locking the sessions i make use of `xautolock`, which locks the session after inactivity and `xss-lock `which listens for systemd events (like `suspend` when the laptop lid is closed) and then runs a locker command. they are started & configured in [xinitrc](../x11/xinitrc).
